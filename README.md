# Welcome to Elunari!
Elunari is a new language formed by player, a new Conlager. Here you can find the source code for Elunari's dictionary.

## What is a Conlag?
Conlag is short for **constructed language**. They are an artificially created language rather than one that has evolved naturally. Conlangs can serve various purposes, such as artistic expression in literature and media (like Tolkienâ€™s Elvish or Dothraki), linguistic experimentation (like Lojban), or facilitating international communication (like Esperanto). They often feature unique grammar, vocabulary, and phonetics, allowing creators to explore new linguistic ideas and cultural identities.

## Can I join?
Elunari is only spoken through a Discord server, where you are only given basic words and you must learn the language on your own by chatting with other users. At the moment, I'm still constructing this and the server, but you will be able to join soon! 

## Who is this for?
This website is specifically for mods of the Elunari server and language. Since conlags are usually learned through naturally speaking with others, there is no provided dictionary for regular members, other than your own. 

## How can I contribute
Mods can contribute to this dictionary in the future.
